Instructions on bits

Problems:

5.Let A and B be two given bytes. Obtain the word C as follows:
- the bits 0-3 from C are equal to the bits 3-6 of B
- the bits 4-7 from C are equal to 0
- the bits 8-10 from C are equal to 110
- the bits 11-15 from C are equal to the bits 0-4 of A

9. Let A be a word and B be a byte. Obtain the byte C as follows:
- the bits 0-3 from C are equal to the bits 6-9 of A
- the bits 4-5 from C are equal to 1
- the bits 6-7 from C are equal to the bits 1-2 of B

10. Replace the bits 0-3 of the byte B with the bits 8-11 of the word A.

11. Let A be a byte and B a word. Obtain the byte C which has the bits 0-3 equal to the bits 2-5 of A and the bits 4-7 equal to the bits 6-9 of B.

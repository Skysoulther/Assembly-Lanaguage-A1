Write two programs in assembly language (16 bits) which solves two arithmetic expressions in both unsigned and signed interpretations.

Chosen expressions:

25. (a*a+b)/(b+b)+c
a-word; b-byte; c-doubleword

26. (a*a+b/c-1)/(b+c)+d
a-word; b-byte; c-word; d-doubleword

Solutions:
P25U.asm ; unsigned solution
P25S.asm ; signed solution
P26U.asm ; unsigned solution
P26S.asm ; signed solution

NOTE: TASM is used!
